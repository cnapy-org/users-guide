## Introduction

Welcome to CNApy's user manual! CNApy [[GitHub]](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy)[[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab828) is a Python-based graphical user interface for a) many common methods of Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) with stoichiometric metabolic models, b) the visualization of COBRA calculation results as *interactive and editable* metabolic maps (including Escher maps [[GitHub]](https://escher.github.io/#/)[[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004321)) and c) the creation and editing of metabolic models.

Supported COBRA methods (partly provided by cobrapy [[GitHub]](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy)[[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-7-74)) include:

- Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) [[Review]](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1614)
- Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2003.09.002)
- Yield optimization (based on linear-fractional programming) [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2018.02.001)
- Phase plane analyses (can include flux and/or yield optimizations)
- Making measured *in vivo* flux scenarios stoichiometrically feasible, optionally also by altering a biomass reaction [[Paper]](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/10/btad600/7284109)
- Elementary Flux Modes (EFM) [[Review]](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/biot.201200269)
- Thermodynamic methods based on OptMDFpathway [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006492)
- Many advanced strain design algorithms such as OptKnock [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.10803), RobustKnock [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp704), OptCouple [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mec.2019.e00087) and advanced Minimal Cut Sets [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008110) through its StrainDesign [[GitHub]](https://github.com/klamt-lab/straindesign)[[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac632) integration

Aside of performing calculations on metabolic models, CNApy can also be used to create and/or edit metabolic models. This includes all important aspects of the model's reactions, metabolites and genes. For model loading and export, CNApy supports the widely used SBML standard format [[Site]](https://sbml.org/)[[Paper]](https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/msb.20199110).

We appreciate any comments or suggestions for improvements and we are greatly interested in your feedback! If you have questions, suggestions or bug reports regarding CNApy, you can use either of the [CNApy GitHub issues](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy/issues), the [CNApy GitHub discussions](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy/discussions) or the [CNApy Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/cnapy-org/community).

Thank you for using CNApy!
