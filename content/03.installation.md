## Installation

### CNApy main program

There are 4 alternative ways to install CNApy:

1. The easiest way for any user to install CNApy is by downloading its installer, which is provided for Windows, Linux and MacOS, see [Using CNApy installer](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy#using-cnapy-installer) for more.
2. If you already have installed Python 3.10 (no other version) on your system, you can install CNApy simply through ```pip install cnapy``` in your console. Afterwards, you can start CNApy's GUI by running either ```cnapy``` or, if this doesn't work, ```python -m cnapy``` where "python" must call your Python 3.10 installation.
3. If you already use conda or mamba (for mamba, just change the "conda" command to "mamba"), you can create a CNApy environment named ```cnapy-1.2.2``` as follows: 1) Run ```conda create --name cnapy-1.2.2 python=3.10 pip```, 2) run ```conda activate cnapy-1.2.2```, 3) run ```pip install cnapy```. Then, you can start CNApy in the cnapy-1.2.2 conda environment by running either ```cnapy``` or, if this doesn't work, ```python -m cnapy```.
4. If you want to develop CNApy, follow the instruction for the cloning and setup of the CNApy repository using git and conda or mamba in section [Setup the CNApy development environment](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy#setup-the-cnapy-development-environment).

*Note*: After CNApy's installation, it is recommended to download the [CNApy example projects](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy-projects) (including interactive maps of models such as [ECC2](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39647), [*i*ML1515](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3956) and many more) by starting CNApy and clicking on "Download CNApy example projects..." in the "Projects" menu entry or by following the first start-up instructions.

### Installing additional solvers (optional)

CNApy itself is already packaged and installed with the open source linear programming solver [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) which is fast enough for simple calculations with small models and which is not restricted in the possible number of variables.

For strain design and thermodyanmic calculations, you can also use the free and open-source solver [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/) which is much faster than GLPK but still often much slower than IBM CPLEX and Gurobi (see next paragraph). You can install SCIP by following the instructions [on its website](https://www.scipopt.org/index.php#download).

In addition, CNApy comes pre-packaged with the Community editions of the much more powerful commercial solvers [IBM CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) and [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/). These community editions can only run with models up to 1000 variables. In order to use one of these solvers with models which contain more variables, the *full versions* of either two of these solvers have to be installed and connected to CNApy.
In order to help you with this process, CNApy contains a wizard which explains the process in detail and which takes over some of the neccessary tasks. You can find these wizards under the "Config" menu entry. Click on the wizard menu entry, and follow the wizard's detailed instructions.
